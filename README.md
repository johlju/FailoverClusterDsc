### xCluster

Used to configure a failover cluster. If the cluster does not exist, it will be
created in the domain and the static IP address will be assigned to the cluster.
When the cluster exist (either it was created or already existed), it will add
the target node ($env:COMPUTERNAME) to the cluster.

#### Requirements for xCluster

* Target machine must be running Windows Server 2008 R2 or later.

#### Parameters for xCluster

* **`[String]` Name** _(Key)_: Name of the failover cluster.
* **`[String]` StaticIPAddress** _(Write)_: The static IP address of the failover
  cluster. If this is not specified then the IP address will be assigned from a
  DHCP.
* **`[String[]]` IgnoreNetwork** _(Write)_: One or more networks to ignore when
  creating the cluster. Only networks using Static IP can be ignored, networks
  that are assigned an IP address through DHCP cannot be ignored, and are added
  for cluster communication. To remove networks assigned an IP address through DHCP
  use the resource xClusterNetwork to change the role of the network. This parameter
  is only used during the creation of the cluster and is not monitored after.
* **`[String]` DomainAdministratorCredential** _(Required)_: Credential used to
  create the failover cluster in Active Directory.

#### Examples for xCluster

* [Create first node of a failover cluster](/Examples/Resources/xCluster/1-CreateFirstNodeOfAFailoverCluster.ps1)
* [Join additional node to a failover cluster](/Examples/Resources/xCluster/2-JoinAdditionalNodeToFailoverCluster.ps1)
* [Create failover cluster with two nodes](/Examples/Resources/xCluster/3-CreateFailoverClusterWithTwoNodes.ps1)
* [Create first node of a failover cluster with DHCP](/Examples/Resources/xCluster/4-CreateFirstNodeOfAFailoverClusterWithDHCP.ps1)
* [Join additional node to a failover cluster with DHCP](/Examples/Resources/xCluster/5-JoinAdditionalNodeToFailoverClusterWithDHCP.ps1)
* [Create failover cluster and ignoring a network](/Examples/Resources/xCluster/4-CreateFailoverClusterAndIgnoreANetwork.ps1)

### xClusterDisk

Configures shared disks in a cluster.

#### Requirements for xClusterDisk

* Target machine must be running Windows Server 2008 R2 or later.

#### Parameters for xClusterDisk

* **`[String]` Number** _(Key)_: The disk number of the cluster disk.
* **`[String]` Ensure** _(Write)_: Define if the cluster disk should be added
  (Present) or removed (Absent). Default value is 'Present'.
  { *Present* | Absent }
* **`[String]` Label** _(Write)_: The disk label that should be assigned to the
  disk on the Failover Cluster disk resource.

#### Examples for xClusterDisk

* [Add a cluster disk to the failover cluster](/Examples/Resources/xClusterDisk/1-AddClusterDisk.ps1)
* [Remove a cluster disk from the failover cluster](/Examples/Resources/xClusterDisk/2-RemoveClusterDisk.ps1)

### xClusterNetwork

Configures a cluster network in a failover cluster.

This resource is only able to change properties on cluster networks.  To add or remove networks from the cluster, add or remove them from the cluster members.  By adding a new subnet on one of the cluster nodes, the network will be added to the cluster, and metadata can be set using the xClusterNetwork module.

#### Requirements for xClusterNetwork

* Target machine must be running Windows Server 2008 R2 or later.

#### Parameters for xClusterNetwork

* **`[String]` Address** _(Key)_: The address for the cluster network in the format
  '10.0.0.0'.
* **`[String]` AddressMask** _(Key)_: The address mask for the cluster network in
  the format '255.255.255.0'.
* **`[String]` Name** _(Write)_: The name of the cluster network. If the cluster
  network name is not in desired state it will be renamed to match this name.
* **`[String]` Role** _(Write)_: The role of the cluster network. If the cluster
  network role is not in desired state it will changed to match this role.
  { 0 | 1 | 3 }.
* **`[String]` Metric** _(Write)_: The metric number for the cluster network. If
  the cluster network metric number is not in desired state it will be changed to
  match this metric number.

#### Role parameter

This parameter sets the role of the cluster network. If the cluster network role
is not in desired state it will change to match this role.

The cluster network role can be set to either the value 0, 1 or 3.

0 = Do not allow cluster network communication
1 = Allow cluster network communication only
3 = Allow cluster network communication and client connectivity

See this article for more information about cluster network role values;
[Configuring Windows Failover Cluster Networks](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askcore/2014/02/19/configuring-windows-failover-cluster-networks/)

#### Examples for xClusterNetwork

* [Change properties of two cluster network resources in the failover cluster](/Examples/Resources/xClusterNetwork/1-ChangeClusterNetwork.ps1)

### xClusterPreferredOwner

cluster.

#### Requirements for xClusterPreferredOwner

#### Parameters for xClusterPreferredOwner

* **`[String]` ClusterGroup** _(Key)_: Name of the cluster group.
* **`[String]` ClusterName** _(Key)_: Name of the cluster.
* **`[String[]]` Nodes** _(Required)_: The nodes to set as owners.
* **`[String[]]` ClusterResources** _(Write)_: The resources to set preferred
  owners on.

quorum type, please see the article
[Understanding Quorum Configurations in a Failover Cluster](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc731739(v=ws.11).aspx).

#### Requirements for xClusterQuorum

* Target machine must be running Windows Server 2008 R2 or later.

#### Parameters for xClusterQuorum

* **`[String]` IsSingleInstance** _(Key)_: Specifies the resource is a single
  instance, the value must be 'Yes'.
* **`[String]` Type** _(Write)_: Quorum type to use. { NodeMajority |
  NodeAndDiskMajority | NodeAndFileShareMajority | NodeAndCloudMajority, DiskOnly }.
* **`[String]` Resource** _(Write)_: The name of the disk, file share or Azure
  storage account resource to use as witness. This parameter is optional if the
  quorum type is set to NodeMajority.
* **`[String]` StorageAccountAccessKey** _(Write)_: The access key of the Azure
  storage account to use as witness. This parameter is required if the quorum
  type is set to NodeAndCloudMajority. The key is currently not updated if the
  resource is already set.' here as well

* [Set quorum to node and cloud](/Examples/Resources/xClusterQuorum/5-SetQuorumToNodeAndCloudMajority.1)

### xWaitForCluster
